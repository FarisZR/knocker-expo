### Web-Specific UI
- [x] Background service toggle is hidden on web
- [x] Silent notification toggle is hidden on web
- [x] All other features work correctly

## ✅ Testing

### Unit Tests
- [x] All 32 tests pass
- [x] 6 test suites pass
- [x] No new test failures introduced

### Linting
- [x] `npm run lint` passes
- [x] No new linting errors introduced

### Browser Testing

#### Desktop Browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox)
- [ ] App loads correctly
- [ ] Service worker registers (check console)
- [ ] Install icon appears in address bar
- [ ] App can be installed as PWA
- [ ] Auto-knock works on page load
- [ ] Manual knock works
- [ ] Settings persist between sessions

#### Mobile Browser (iOS Safari/Android Chrome)
- [ ] App loads correctly
- [ ] Responsive layout works
- [ ] "Add to Home Screen" option available
- [ ] App installs correctly
- [ ] Auto-knock works on launch
- [ ] Touch interactions work smoothly

## 🔍 Debugging Checklist

If PWA features don't work:

1. **Manifest not loading**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify manifest.json is at root of domain
   - Check HTTPS is enabled (required for PWA)

2. **Service worker not registering**
   - Check browser console for registration errors
   - Verify service-worker.js is at root of domain
   - Check HTTPS is enabled
   - Clear browser cache and reload

3. **Icons not displaying**
   - Verify icons exist at specified paths
   - Check icon sizes match manifest
   - Ensure icons are accessible (check Network tab)

4. **Auto-knock not working**
   - Open browser DevTools console
   - Check for JavaScript errors
   - Verify credentials are saved (Application > Local Storage)
   - Verify endpoint URL is correct
