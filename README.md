# Knocker-EXPO: React EXPO client for [Knocker](https://github.com/FarisZR/Knocker)

Knocker-EXPO is an app for Knocker written in Expo (React Native) that provides a convenient way to whitelist your device's IP address with a compatible server. It is designed for users who need temporary access to protected networks or services and want a simple, reliable tool to manage it.

## ‚ú® Features

- **One-Tap Whitelisting:** A prominent "Knock" button to instantly whitelist your current IP address.
- **Automatic Knock:** The app automatically knocks on launch
- **Background Service:** An optional background service that re-knocks with a schedule of at least 15 minutes to ensure your access doesn't expire.
- **Reliability Hints:** Automatic detection of missed background runs with Android-specific guidance to disable battery optimizations when needed.
- **Secure Storage:** All sensitive credentials (endpoint, token) are stored securely on your device using `expo-secure-store`.

## Install

The app has been tested on android.
An apk is available under the latest release in the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/FarisZR/knocker-expo/releases).
